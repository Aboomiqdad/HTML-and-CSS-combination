            <h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
            <a>
                I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Anatomy from Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, where I developed a deep understanding of the human body and its intricate functions. Throughout my academic journey, I gained expertise in areas such as human physiology, histology, and clinical anatomy, which has shaped my scientific and analytical thinking.
                While my academic foundation lies in anatomy, I discovered a passion for programming during my final year of study. I was drawn to the creativity and problem-solving aspects of coding, which allow for the development of innovative solutions to complex challenges. Programming offers a unique blend of logic and artistry that has captivated my interest, and I have since dedicated time to learning programming languages such as HTML,CSS, Website design and Bootstrap till now, through online courses and self-study.
                Although I come from a background in life sciences, I am excited by the potential to integrate my knowledge of biology with technology, whether through bioinformatics, health tech, or purely creative coding projects. I believe that my scientific background, combined with my growing programming skills, positions me to explore interdisciplinary opportunities that merge health and technology.In the future, I aspire to continue learning and developing my skills in programming, with a focus on fields like health tech or software development. I look forward to applying my unique perspective, blending creativity with analytical skills, to contribute to the innovative world of programming.
